_(not an ingame image)_

TuxlaGL is a Javascript/HTML5 3D web browser game. I's a remake of my [Tuxla3D](http://pi-mobile.com/index.php/product/game/tuxla/view/14/) 
game which is available only for J2ME enabled handsets. 

    This game would be **much different** from the original.

The rules of Tuxla are pretty simple but I would like to experiment with a darker ingame atmosphere including some 3D effects.
